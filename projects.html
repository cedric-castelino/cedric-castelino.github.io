    <p>This web portfolio was created entirely through the use of HTML and CSS. The website utilises a range of interactive <br>elements, allowing for a 
      more engaging viewing experience. The main aim of this project is to showcase my skills <br>and experience in the field of software development and provide 
    an overview of my contact details. The website itself <br>uses a modern colour palette, with contrasting colours used to showcase user input and interaction. The 
  site also <br>utilises a range of animations and multimedia forms to convey information to the user.</p>

    <p>This game is a 2D explorer, where the player is put into dynamic environments, with a range of enemies, allies and items. <br> To create this game, I worked 
      collaboratively with one other member, to generate the backend functionality for various <br> elements of the game. This was done entirely in Java and resulted in a 
    fully functional game. Furthermore, we wrote and <br>completed rigorous testing for the game, exploring a range of cases. </p>
    <p>The game was created for a UNSW course (COMP2511), and required skills in problem-solving, communication and <br>documentation for its completion. This documentation included 
      UML diagrams, inline comments and weekly blog updates <br>with reflections.

      <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></div></a>
    <p>This program was an introduction to object-oriented programming, simulating a range of satellites and devices, each with <br>different attributes. The program would 
      calculate the orbital movement of the satellites and their distances were used to <br>check their communicative range. This range also impacted the attribute of file sharing, which 
      required functionality for file <br>sizes, contents and the impact of moving out of the designated distance while transferring the file. Tests were also written <br>for a variety of cases.
    </p>
    <p>The program was created for a UNSW course (COMP2511) and required skills in problem-solving and documentation for its <br>completion. This documentation included

    <p>For this program, I collaborated with 3 other individuals to write the functionality for the backend of a Microsoft Teams Clone, <br>entitiled 'UNSW Beans'. This required a 
      range of functionality, such as accounts, channels, messaging, notifications and profile <br> photos. This was completed entirely using TypeScript and also required an array 
      of specific tests to be written. 
    </p>
    <p>The program was created for a UNSW course (COMP1531), and required skills in problem-solving, communication and <br>documentation for its completion. The collaborative aspect of
      tasks assigned, completed and their due dates were set up <br>using GitLab milestones and required strict adherence to the timeline of tasks set. The documentation included 
      recorded <br>conversations and meetings, as well as inline comments.

    <p>Cloudy Minds is an organisational application for macOS made using Xcode. The application has a range of features, <br>such as stored timetables, note-taking, assignment tracking
      homework recording and Zoom link storage. The application was <br>personalised for the secondary school: Parramatta Marist High, and hence, included specific aspects, such as a shared diary <br>format,
      customised avatars with different uniforms and a merit/demerit system. The application also saved all information <br>locally, allowing users to continue their work, even after reinstalling.
      Help sections with images were also provided on each <br>page to help users become acclimated with the program.
    </p>
    <p>The project was completed individually in its entirety and was heavily documented. Over 90 pages of developer documentation<br> was written, accompanied by several guides for
      installation, referencing and user operation. The application was made using <br>the entire software development cycle and hence, underwent the stages of requirement analysis, planning, 
      software design, <br>software development and testing rigorously.

    <p>Cyber Escape is an infinite side-scrolling game, made using Pygame. The game utilises a range of dynamic backgrounds, <br>sprites and sound effects to generate an immersive experience, where the 
      player must dodge oncoming obstacles to try <br>and get the highest score. The player can choose from 3 characters, each with a unique ability that is customised to the <br>specific
      character. Each player also gets a super jump ability. Furthermore, the player can choose an additional power-up <br>from a selection of 3 possible options, each providing some 
      extra functionality. 
    </p>
    <p>The game also includes 3 obstacles that are randomly generated as the game continues. These obstacles attack for different <br>health amounts and at different heights, requiring the 
      player to either jump or slide for avoidance. The game was heavily <br>documented throughout the development process, and a user manual can be seen posted on the game website. The game<br> was 
      beta-tested by multiple individuals, resulting in meaningful changes for the final version.

      <div class="giticon">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></div></a>
    <p>This application is a self-checkout program, made using PySimpleGUI. The program uses a 4-digit code with randomly <br>generated alternating letters and numbers to save the user's
      name as an account. The program then offers a range of <br>items for sale, where the user can add them to their shopping cart if the selection does not exceed the stock amount. <br>The 
      user also has a fully customisable cart, allowing them to remove certain items. The user can then pay using cash, <br>a card or a gift card code. The program has several different pages, but 
      employs an intuitive navigation system to keep <br>the user from being overwhelmed. 
    </p>
    <p>The application also caters to individuals who suffer from colour blindness, offering different colour options such as the <br>Coles colour scheme (default), dark mode, light mode and 
      colour blind mode. Moreover, the program is constantly taking <br>in user input and completing tasks and calculations based on this process.
